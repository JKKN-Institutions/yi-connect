# 🚀 DEVELOPER GUIDE for Yi Chapter Management (3)

[cite_start]**YI-CONNECT UNIFIED SYSTEM: COMPLETE EXTENSION GUIDE** [cite: 1]
[cite_start]**For Yi Chapter Chair, Co-Chair & EC Members** [cite: 2]
**Updated: November 2025 | [cite_start]Version 2.0** [cite: 3]

## WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR

[cite_start]This guide explains how we're upgrading yi-connect to solve **EVERY operational pain point** in Yi Erode[cite: 6]. [cite_start]Think of this as a blueprint that shows: [cite: 7]

- [cite_start]What problems we're solving [cite: 8]
- [cite_start]How the system will work (with real examples) [cite: 9]
- [cite_start]What changes are needed to the current system [cite: 10]

### [cite_start]What's New in Version 2.0: [cite: 11]

- [cite_start]✅ **Coordinator Portal** (schools/colleges/industries can book sessions directly) [cite: 12]
- [cite_start]✅ **Skill-Will Matrix** (AI-powered assessment to assign members to right verticals) [cite: 13]
- [cite_start]✅ **Chapter Hierarchy** (manage Yuva chapters at colleges, Thalir chapters at schools) [cite: 14]
- [cite_start]✅ **Industry Opportunities** (companies post CSR opportunities, members apply) [cite: 15]
- [cite_start]✅ **Trainer Auto-Assignment** (no more WhatsApp "Who's free?" messages) [cite: 16]
- [cite_start]✅ **Materials Approval Workflow** (no more WhatsApp PPT sharing) [cite: 17]
- [cite_start]✅ **Carpool Coordination** (structured carpooling for sessions) [cite: 18]
- [cite_start]✅ **Real-Time Metrics** (exact beneficiary counts, not estimates) [cite: 19]

## [cite_start]SECTION 1: MEMBERSHIP MANAGEMENT - IMPROVEMENTS & NEW FEATURES [cite: 21]

### [cite_start]What Already Exists [cite: 22]

[cite_start]Currently, yi-connect Module 1 tracks: [cite: 23]

- [cite_start]80 Yi Erode members (name, company, email, phone) [cite: 24]
- [cite_start]Membership status (active/inactive/renewed) [cite: 25]
- [cite_start]Basic engagement tracking (event attendance) [cite: 26]

### [cite_start]Problem We're Solving [cite: 27]

[cite_start]**Pain Point 1: New Members Don't Know Where They Fit** [cite: 28]

- [cite_start]**Current Reality:** Deepa joins Yi Erode $\rightarrow$ Attends monthly meet $\rightarrow$ Chair asks: "Which vertical interests you?"[cite: 29, 30]. [cite_start]Deepa (uncertain): "I'm not sure, maybe events?"[cite: 31]. [cite_start]3 months later: Deepa rarely participates (wrong vertical)[cite: 32].
- [cite_start]**Result:** 30% of new members become inactive within 6 months[cite: 33].
- [cite_start]**Root Cause:** No structured assessment of skills + interests [cite: 35][cite_start], vertical assignment is random ("we need more people in Thalir, join there") [cite: 36][cite_start], and members feel underutilized or overwhelmed[cite: 37].

---

### [cite_start]Solution: Skill-Will Matrix Assessment System [cite: 39]

#### [cite_start]What We're Adding: [cite: 40]

[cite_start]When new members join (or existing members want to switch verticals), they fill a **5-question AI-adaptive form** that: [cite: 41, 42]

- [cite_start]Assesses their **SKILL** level (teaching, organizing, networking, etc.) [cite: 43]
- [cite_start]Assesses their **WILL** (interest, passion, time availability) [cite: 44]
- [cite_start]Suggests which vertical they're best suited for (Chair makes final decision) [cite: 45]

#### [cite_start]How It Works: [cite: 46]

[cite_start]**Step 1: Member Fills Assessment** [cite: 47]

- [cite_start]**Question 1 (Same for Everyone):** What energizes you most when volunteering? [cite: 48, 49]
  - [cite_start]Teaching and mentoring students/children [cite: 50]
  - [cite_start]Organizing events and coordinating teams [cite: 51]
  - [cite_start]Building corporate partnerships [cite: 52]
  - [cite_start]Hands-on fieldwork (community drives) [cite: 53]
  - [cite_start]Creative work (social media, design) [cite: 54]
  - [cite_start]**💡 [AI Helper]** Click for personalized suggestion [cite: 55]
    - [cite_start]**AI Helper Example:** System knows: Deepa is 28, HR Manager, has 2 kids (ages 6 and 8)[cite: 57]. [cite_start]AI suggests: "Teaching students/children"[cite: 58]. [cite_start]Reason shown: "As a mother of young children, you have daily experience with this age group"[cite: 59]. [cite_start]Deepa can accept suggestion or choose herself[cite: 60].
- [cite_start]**Question 2 (Changes Based on Q1 Answer):** If Deepa selected "Teaching": Which age group do you feel most comfortable with? [cite: 61, 62, 63]
  - [cite_start]Young children (Age 5-12) - Thalir focus [cite: 64]
  - [cite_start]Teenagers/college (Age 15-22) - Yuva focus [cite: 65]
  - [cite_start]Adults (Age 25+) - Corporate training [cite: 66]
  - [cite_start]All ages equally [cite: 67]
  - [cite_start]**💡 [AI Helper]** Your kids are ages 6-8, suggests "Young children" [cite: 68]
- [cite_start]**Questions 3-5 Continue This Pattern:** [cite: 69]
  - [cite_start]Q3: Skill level (Expert/Intermediate/Beginner/None) [cite: 70]
  - [cite_start]Q4: Time commitment (15+ hrs, 10-15 hrs, 5-10 hrs, <2 hrs/month) [cite: 71]
  - [cite_start]Q5: Travel willingness (Erode city, district, neighboring, all TN) [cite: 72]

- [cite_start]**Add New Tab:** "Skill-Will Assessment" [cite: 104]
- [cite_start]**What It Shows:** If pending: "⚠️ Assessment not completed - Complete within 7 days"[cite: 106]. [cite_start]If completed: Full results (vertical recommended, category, mentor assigned, training plan)[cite: 107].
- [cite_start]**When to Show:** All members (mandatory for new members within 7 days) [cite: 108]

#### [cite_start]Change 2: Add "Trainer Profile" Tab [cite: 110]

- [cite_start]**Where:** Member profile page (same location) [cite: 111]
- [cite_start]**Show ONLY if:** Member is assigned to Thalir, Yuva, Masoom, or Road Safety verticals [cite: 112]
- [cite_start]**What It Shows (Example for Priya Navin):** [cite: 113, 114]

| Section                       | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Certifications:**           | [cite_start]Masoom TOT Level 2 ✅ (Jan 2024) [cite: 116][cite_start], Road Safety Trainer ✅ (Mar 2023) [cite: 117]                                                                                        |
| **Performance:**              | [cite_start]Total Sessions: 12 [cite: 119][cite_start], Students Impacted: 1,440 [cite: 120][cite_start], Average Rating: 4.9/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ [cite: 121][cite_start], Last Session: Nov 20, 2025 [cite: 122] |
| **Fair Distribution Status:** | [cite_start]Sessions This Month: 1 [cite: 124][cite_start], Days Since Last: 15 days [cite: 125][cite_start], Status: ✅ Available for assignments [cite: 126]                                             |

- [cite_start]\[Update Availability Calendar] \[View Session History] [cite: 127]

#### [cite_start]Change 3: Add "Availability Calendar" Page [cite: 129]

- [cite_start]**Where:** New page `/members/[id]/availability` [cite: 130]
- [cite_start]**What It Does:** Shows next 6 months in calendar view[cite: 132]. [cite_start]Trainer clicks dates to mark as: **Available** (green), **Blocked** (red), or **Assigned** (blue)[cite: 133, 134, 135, 136].
- [cite_start]**Example View Legend:** ✅ = Assigned (conducting session) [cite: 143][cite_start], 🔒 = Weekend/Holiday (auto-blocked) [cite: 144][cite_start], ⚪ = Not marked (click to mark available) [cite: 145][cite_start], ❌ = Manually blocked[cite: 146].

#### [cite_start]Change 4: Update Members List View [cite: 152]

- [cite_start]**Where:** Members list page (`/members`) [cite: 153]
- **Add These Columns:** | Name | Vertical | Skill-Will Category | [cite_start]Assessment Status | [cite: 155, 156]
  - [cite_start]Example: Priya Navin $\rightarrow$ Thalir $\rightarrow$ ⭐ Star $\rightarrow$ ✅ Completed[cite: 158, 159]. [cite_start]Deepa Ramesh $\rightarrow$ Thalir $\rightarrow$ 🌟 Enthusiast $\rightarrow$ ✅ Completed[cite: 160, 161].

### [cite_start]Impact Metrics: [cite: 176]

- [cite_start]Member retention: 70% $\rightarrow$ 85% (reduce dropouts by 50%) [cite: 177]
- [cite_start]Time to first contribution: 6 months $\rightarrow$ 2 months [cite: 178]
- [cite_start]Member satisfaction: 85%+ say "I'm in the right role" [cite: 179]

## [cite_start]SECTION 2: STAKEHOLDER CRM - COORDINATOR PORTAL & CHAPTER MANAGEMENT [cite: 181]

### [cite_start]What Already Exists [cite: 182]

[cite_start]Currently, yi-connect Module 2 has: [cite: 183]

- [cite_start]List of schools, colleges, industries [cite: 184]
- [cite_start]Basic contact info (name, phone, email) [cite: 185]
- [cite_start]Stakeholder type (school/college/industry) [cite: 186]

### [cite_start]Problems We're Solving [cite: 187]

[cite_start]**Pain Point 2: WhatsApp Booking Chaos** [cite: 188]

- [cite_start]**Current Reality:** Mrs. Bharathi (Railway Colony School) wants Masoom session $\rightarrow$ WhatsApp to Thalir Chair: "Can we get session Dec 5, 2pm, 120 students?"[cite: 189, 190, 191]. [cite_start]Chair manually checks trainer availability[cite: 192]. [cite_start]After 2 days: "Confirmed, Priya will come"[cite: 193]. [cite_start]Mrs. Bharathi changes the date[cite: 194].
- [cite_start]**Result:** 5-7 days from request to confirmation[cite: 195].

[cite_start]**Pain Point 3: Yuva/Thalir Chapters Are Invisible** [cite: 196]

- [cite_start]**Current Reality:** Sengunthar College has a Yuva chapter (25 student members, 15 events/year, 800 students reached)[cite: 198]. [cite_start]These metrics don't show in the Yi Erode annual report[cite: 199].
- [cite_start]**Cannot Track:** Which Yi members mentor which chapters, chapter health status[cite: 200].

---

### [cite_start]Solution Part A: Authenticated Coordinator Portal [cite: 202]

[cite_start]**KEY DECISION:** Building an **authenticated** coordinator portal (only authorized coordinators can login) instead of a public one[cite: 203, 204].

- [cite_start]**Why Authenticated is Better:** Security [cite: 206][cite_start], Accountability [cite: 207][cite_start], Relationship-based model [cite: 208][cite_start], and Quality control[cite: 209].

#### [cite_start]How Coordinator Setup Works [cite: 211]

[cite_start]**Step 1: Admin Creates Coordinator Account** [cite: 212]

1.  [cite_start]Thalir Chair goes to Stakeholders $\rightarrow$ Clicks "Railway Colony School" $\rightarrow$ Clicks "Add Coordinator"[cite: 213, 214, 215, 216].
2.  [cite_start]Fills form (Name: Mrs. Bharathi, Role: Principal, Email: `bharathi@railway.edu.in`) and clicks "Create Account"[cite: 217, 218, 219, 220, 222].
3.  [cite_start]System auto-generates Password (`RailwayCol@2025`) and sends a welcome email with a login link[cite: 223, 224, 225].

[cite_start]**Step 2: Coordinator First Login** [cite: 227]

- [cite_start]Mrs. Bharathi logs in using the temporary password and sees her dashboard[cite: 237].

| Section     | Details                                                                                                                                     |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Welcome** | WELCOME, MRS. [cite_start]BHARATHI, Railway Colony School Coordinator Portal [cite: 238, 239]                                               |
| **Impact**  | [cite_start]Total Sessions: 4 [cite: 241][cite_start], Students Impacted: 438 [cite: 242][cite_start], Average Rating: 4.9/5 ⭐ [cite: 243] |
| **Action**  | [cite_start]\[Book New Session] $\leftarrow$ Big button [cite: 245]                                                                         |
| **History** | [cite_start]List of past sessions with rating/students impacted [cite: 246, 247, 248, 249, 250]                                             |

[cite_start]**Step 3: Coordinator Books Session** [cite: 252]

1.  [cite_start]**Step 1: Choose Session Type**[cite: 254]. [cite_start]Shows options like Masoom, Road Safety, Career Guidance[cite: 256, 257, 258, 259]. [cite_start]**💡 SMART SUGGESTION:** Reminds her the school books Masoom most and suggests Class 5 hasn't had it this year[cite: 260, 261, 263]. [cite_start]She selects "Masoom"[cite: 265].
2.  [cite_start]**Step 2: Real-Time Availability**[cite: 266]. [cite_start]Shows a calendar with real-time trainer availability (e.g., Dec 5: ✅ 5 trainers available, Dec 10: ❌ No trainers available)[cite: 268, 270, 272]. [cite_start]**💡 SUGGESTION:** Highlights Dec 5 as it matches her usual Friday preference[cite: 273]. [cite_start]She clicks Dec 5 $\rightarrow$ Sees time slots (Morning/Afternoon) and selects Afternoon (1-3pm) $\leftarrow$ RECOMMENDED based on past pattern[cite: 277, 280, 282, 283].
3.  [cite_start]**Step 3: Student Details**[cite: 284]. [cite_start]Asks for Expected Students (125) and Grade (Class 6)[cite: 285, 286]. [cite_start]System remembers Class 6 had Masoom before and asks if it's a refresher[cite: 287, 288]. [cite_start]Allows preference for Gender and Language (Tamil + English $\leftarrow$ Recommended)[cite: 290, 291, 294, 295].
4.  [cite_start]**Step 4: Review & Confirm**[cite: 297]. [cite_start]Shows summary and **WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:** Yi assigns trainers within 24 hrs, materials uploaded 3 days before, trainer calls 1 day before[cite: 305, 306, 307, 308]. [cite_start]She clicks "Confirm Booking"[cite: 311].
5.  **Confirmation:** ✅ BOOKING CONFIRMED! [cite_start]Status is 🟡 Pending Trainer Assignment[cite: 313, 315].

### [cite_start]Solution Part B: Chapter Hierarchy Management [cite: 387]

- [cite_start]**Sub-Chapters:** Student-led clubs at colleges (Yuva) or schools (Thalir)[cite: 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 395]. [cite_start]They organize events on campus, track their own metrics, and report to Yi Erode[cite: 396, 397, 408, 409]. [cite_start]Yi members mentor them[cite: 398].

- [cite_start]If **NO** chapter: \[+ Create Yuva/Thalir Chapter] button[cite: 493, 494].

### [cite_start]Impact Metrics: [cite: 496]

- [cite_start]Booking time: 5-7 days $\rightarrow$ 24 hours (85% faster) [cite: 497]
- [cite_start]WhatsApp messages: 15 per booking $\rightarrow$ 0 (100% reduction) [cite: 498]
